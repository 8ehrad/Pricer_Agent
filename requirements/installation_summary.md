## Installation Notes

### macOS Compatibility
- PyTorch was installed with macOS ARM64 support (Apple Silicon compatible)
- CUDA-specific versions were not available for macOS, so standard versions were used
- All packages are compatible with your macOS 24.6.0 system

### Version Compatibility
- All packages are using the latest compatible versions
- Some packages were upgraded from older versions during installation
- The installation resolved dependency conflicts automatically

### Ready to Use
Your environment is now ready to run all the notebooks in the Product Pricer project:

1. **Data Curation** (`data_curation1.ipynb`, `data_curation2.ipynb`)
2. **Model Training** (`Copy_of_Week_7_Day_3_TRAINING.ipynb`)
3. **Model Testing** (`Copy_of_Week_7_Day_5_Testing_our_Fine_tuned_model.ipynb`)

## Next Steps

1. **Set up environment variables** in a `.env` file:
   ```
   HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key (optional)
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key (optional)
   ```

2. **Start Jupyter** to run the notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Begin with data curation** in `data_curation1.ipynb`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- The `fsspec` version conflict warning is expected and can be ignored
- All packages are properly installed and should work together
- For CUDA-specific issues, note that you're on macOS which uses Metal Performance Shaders instead of CUDA
